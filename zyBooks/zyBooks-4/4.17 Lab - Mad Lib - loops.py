"""
Mad Libs are activities that have a person provide various words,
which are then used to complete a short story in unexpected (and hopefully funny) ways.

Write a program that takes a string and an integer as input, and outputs a sentence using
the input values as shown in the example below. The program repeats until the input string is quit and disregards the integer input that follows.

Ex: If the input is:

apples 5
shoes 2
quit 0

the output is:

Eating 5 apples a day keeps the doctor away.
Eating 2 shoes a day keeps the doctor away.

while True:
    text = input()
    word, number = text.split()

    if word == "quit":
        break

    print(f"Eating {number} {word} a day keeps the doctor away.")
